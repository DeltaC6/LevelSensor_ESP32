 * @note    This is a library for Magnetostrictive Probe - (SYWA) written in
 *          C++ on ESP32 Arduino Core Framework.
 * 
 *          This library enables user to access all of sensor operations as 
 *          mentioned in the datasheet as well as allows the user to use this
 *          library on daisy chain sensor network.
